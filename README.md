# Innovation_in_science
Project aimed to analyze, describe and predict the impact of scientific publications.  I study here the corpus of abstracts, citations, authors and author affiliations for millions of publications made in the UK since 1980. Using graph theory and NLP I will be able to identify what type of collaborations result in a more innovative paper.

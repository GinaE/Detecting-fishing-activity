# Fishing-Net
In this project I will collaborate with [Global Fishing Watch](http://www.globalfishingwatch.org/) to detect fishing activity in the ocean using data from satellite Automatic Identification System [AIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_identification_system) collected from different vessels around the world. The AIS data contains the latitude, longitude, speed and course of the vessels at different times.
